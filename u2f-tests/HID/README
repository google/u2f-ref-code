WHAT:
A couple of self-contained u2f HID device conformance tests:
HIDTest to check compliance at the usb HID communication layer.
U2FTest to check compliance at the application layer.

DEPENDENCIES:
git clone https://github.com/libusb/hidapi
git clone -b lollipop-release https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core

linux: sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

BUILD:
linux, mac: make

windows: nmake -f Makefile.win
  - if you have an old vc compiler, consider adding
    http://msinttypes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stdint.h
    or similar to your vc include directory.

RUN:
./list
  to find path of device to test (e.g. /dev/hidraw3)

./HIDTest $PATH [args]?
  to test low level communications with device.
  On windows?
  - Make sure to keep the quotes around the path.
  - Try https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon to get ANSI colors.
  On linux?
  - Make sure path is rw for your uid. Typically, a udev rule that adds
    rw for group plugdev goes a long way.

./U2FTest $PATH [args]?
  to test u2f application layer functionality of device.

Additional commandline arguments:
Add -a to continue execution after an error.
Add -p to pause after each error.
Add -v and -V to get more verbose output, down to the usb frames with -V.
Add -b to U2FTest in case fob under test is of the insert / remove
  class and does not have a user-presence button.
